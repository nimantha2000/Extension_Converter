# Image Format Converter

## Overview
This Python script converts images from one format to another. It utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to open and save images.

## Features
- **Bulk Conversion**: Converts multiple images in a directory from one format to another.
- **Error Handling**: Provides error handling for cases where images cannot be opened or saved.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple to use, no complex configurations required.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

4. Place the script in the directory containing the images you want to convert.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
6. Modify the `convert_images` function call at the end of the script with the desired source and target extensions.
7. Run the script:
8. The script will automatically convert all images from the source format to the target format in the same directory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8
- Pillow library (installed via `pip install Pillow`)
